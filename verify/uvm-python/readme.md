##  Overview

The efabless-uvm-env is a project aimed at providing a comprehensive and reusable environment for Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) based verification flows. The environment should be suatable for any IP(Intellectual Property) with a wrapper generated by efabless wrapper generator. It offers a collection of modules, libraries, and utilities that facilitate the development and execution of UVM-based testbenches. By leveraging this codebase, engineers can streamline the verification process, improve code reuse, and enhance productivity. The efabless-uvm-env project embodies the value proposition of enabling efficient and standardized UVM-based verification, ultimately leading to reliable and robust hardware designs.

| [wrapper_logger.py](wrapper_env/wrapper_logger/wrapper_logger.py) | The code in the `wrapper_logger.py` file is a component that logs bus and IRQ activities in the wrapper environment. It analyzes transactions and writes them to a log file in a tabular format. The log file is created during the configuration phase. |

| [ip_if.py](ip_files/ip_if.py)           | The code snippet in `ip_files/ip_if.py` defines an interface class `ip_if` that inherits from `sv_if`. It initializes a bus map and passes it to the parent class. The interface class represents the actual signals of an IP module in the `efabless-uvm-env` repository's architecture, such as RX and TX. |
| [wrapper_if.py](ip_files/wrapper_if.py) | This code snippet, located in the wrapper_if.py file, defines interface classes for the wrapper bus and IRQ signals. These classes map the signals to their corresponding names.                                                                                                                             |

##  Getting Started

***note***

As this project is in development, a lot of changes should be made to verify new ip but it's planned to make most of class as generic as possible.

***files to modify***

Copy the all files from and update the following files:
- Makefile
    - Modify the relative paths to the verilog files
- ip_if.py
    - Modify the bus map with new ip signals
- ip_driver.py and ip_montor.py 
    - Modify the reading and writing to the signals
- vip.py
    - Update the model with the new ip specifications
- ip_coverage.py
    - Add coverage groups for the new IP
- ip_logger.py
    - Update logging columns names and data types
- Add new sequences
- test_lib
    - Add tests that uses the new sequences
